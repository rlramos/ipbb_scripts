Creating a Juniper RMA Case: (Priority 3 for replacement)
 To open a Juniper RMA case, you'll need to upload the rsi and log files.

1. First collect the RSI file and save it to /var/temp/: on the device
    1. > request support information | save /var/tmp/rsi-bb04-iad3.txt
											rsi_<hostname.txt>
2. Compress the RSI file into a tgz format.
    1. > file archive source /var/tmp/rsi_bb04-iad3.txt compress destination /var/tmp/rsi-bb04-iad3

	i. To confirm file is in the directory, enter the command below:
	> file list /var/tmp/
	> file list detail /var/tmp

3. Afterwards, you'll need to send the file from your router to your dev server:
    1. > scp <user@devicename>:/var/tmp/<rsi-xxxx.tgz> /home/<username>
		-This is done on your devserver.
	i. example: 
		scp halmahdi@bb04.iad3:/var/tmp/rsi-bb04-iad3.tgz /home/halmahdi
