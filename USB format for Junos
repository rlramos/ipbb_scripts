Upgrading firmware on a Juniper device via USB
1. Have SH rack device and cabled all connections including management/console port back.
2. Console into new device and have SH tech share screen via beyond trust remote support/bomgar or Zoom with remote control.
    1. Serial connection to laptop or usb/serial connection. 
        1. Putty,
            1. Open control panel -> Device manager -> COM_$_console (COM number is their serial/console adaptor)
            2. Go to Putty and change to COM$ connection 
                1. Speed set at 9600 
3. Uploaded firmware <18.1r2-s3.3> to oobsr (scp) or dropbox. (Vm whatif <hostname>)
    1. net_versioner -v juniper -d ^poe --device_summary (verify firmware for PROD devices)
    2. Netcode list | grep <juniper_junos_18.1r2-s3.3-ex4300> 
    3. Netcode info <exact_file_name>
        1. Will provide details and download links which you can save to your devserver.
            1. Upload the file to dropbox or a nearby device. (Serf: https://fburl.com/serf/39cqd2c1)
5. Copy firmware to USB from UPLINK or NEARBY device to upgrade replacement RMA device. If file is too big, alternative is sharing file through dropbox
    1. On device, JUNOS use ‘start shell user root’ to enter shell mode
        1. Verify if USB is detected
            1. ‘. ls <dev>/da*’
            2. Note changes in where flash drive is connected
        2. Mount flash drive and cp file to device /var/tmp directory. 
            1. https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB12880
                    1.  ‘mount_msdosfs /dev/da0s1 /var/tmp/usb’
                    2. ‘cp /var/tmp/usb/junos-vmhost-install-ptx-x86-64-17.2R1-S6.3.tgz /var/tmp’
                    3. ‘’umount /var/tmp/usb”
            2. Use command ‘# ls -lh’ for details and date           
6.  Upgrade and reboot  
    1. ‘request system software add /var/tmp/<file_name> no-validate reboot’
7. Verify new version has been updated and zeroize the device to enable ZTP
    1. > request system Zerorize
    2. > request vmhost zeroize 
8. With mgmt link up, the device will begin to be half provisioned with IP address and hostname configured. Run vm configure and follow up with BBE Provisioning Support for any conflicts in vm job
