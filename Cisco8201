Cisco 8201 replacement

- Rack new device
- Update SN and MAC on SERF
- Remove NIC info
- Ensure ZTP is enabledâ€¨- https://fb.workplace.com/groups/ciscobbe/permalink/1224537784871168/
    - Set username: ipbb
    - Set pass: cisco123
    - # ztp enable
    - # ztp initiate management
    - Use this method below if vm was run and credentials were added but uplink step is the conflict
        - Wipe config
        - (#ztp clean)
            - If vm already has credentials use 
            -  vending_machine_ztpv2
            - [ralphramos@173280.od ~]$ secrets_tool get_group NETENG_AUTOMATION | grep ^VENDING_MACHINE_ZTPV2
    - # exit
- Verify all uplink ports between server nodes and msw interfaces are restored
    - With onsite tech verify the server information by checking the serial number on the host/node
        - From there you can check serf for the hostname name and MAC address
    - You can also check the serial number pull tag on the server itself

Reason VM failed was because 3 MAC addresses were missing (3 servers were down)
